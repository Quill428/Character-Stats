just a simple random number generator that simulates stats for TTRPGs
that generates 4 numbers then takes the 3 highest from to resulted numbers, 
does that 6 times 
then if all 6 of them added together aren't greater or equal to 65 total it will retry until it passes that
and does this two times 
in the end you will have two rows of 6 numbers both equalling or over 65

this took roughly 2-3 hours to make with as little of AI help as possible (mainly used to clean up the code)
